General Perks List
Natural Illusionist
You know the Minor Illusion cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting modifier for it. You are proficient in its casting.
Gnomish Obsession
You gain Apprentice proficiency with one skill of your choice. At 5th level, your proficiency with this skill increases by one level (up to a maximum of Expert).
Speak with small beasts
Through sound and gestures, you may communicate simple ideas with small or smaller beasts.
Artificer's Lore
Whenever you make a History check related to magical, alchemical, or technological items, you can do so with advantage. You have Apprentice proficiency in the Lore / History skill.
Nimble
You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.
Gnomish Tinkering
You have Apprentice proficiency in crafting. You can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp).
The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.
These devices can be used to create a number of effects. The Prestidigitation cantrip is a good baseline for such effects, though your DM has the final ruling
Low-Light Vision
You can see in dim light as though it were by torchlight, but cannot see in darkness.
