General Perks List
Breath Weapon
You can use an action to exhale destructive energy. When you use your breath weapon, all creatures in the target area must make a saving throw, the type and shape of which is determined by your ancestry.
The DC of this saving throw is 9 + your Constitution modifier + your level. A creature takes 2d6 + your Constitution modifier damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is determined by your ancestry.
The damage increases to 3d6 at 3rd level, 4d6 at 5th, and 5d6 at 10th level.
You may use your breath weapon once per day.
Hardened Scales
Your scales provide you with a natural suit of armor. Your scales provide a Defense bonus of +3, with no Dexterity cap, and an Armor value of 1.
Draconic Claws
You grow retractable claws from the tips of your fingers. Extending or retracting the claws requires no action. The claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the normal bludgeoning damage for an unarmed strike.
Iron Jaws
You can use your action to make a visceral bite attack with your draconic maw. This attack does damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, and provides you with a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt with this attack.
You are proficient with this attack, but can only gain its benefits once per day.
Imposing Predator
You gain Apprentice proficiency in the intimidation skill, and have advantage on all saving throws against becoming frightened.
Survivalist
You gain Trained proficiency in the survival skill.
Low-Light Vision
You can see in dim light as though it were by torchlight, but cannot see in darkness.
